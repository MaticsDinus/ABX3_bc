The raw dataset can be accessed from Briones et al. [1] and Alfares et al. [2]. The dataset used includes 122 ABX₃ perovskites with 12 physicochemical descriptors used as features, while LC is the target. Among the descriptors used are Ionic Radius (r_A for A-site cations, r_B for B-site transition metals, and r_X for X-site ions, both halides and oxygen), Density (D_A for A-site elements, D_B for B-site elements, and (D_X for X-site ions), Electronegativity (X_A for A-site, X_B for B-site, and X_X for X-site ions), and Atomic Number (Z_A for A-site, Z_B for B-site, and Z_X for X-site ions).
